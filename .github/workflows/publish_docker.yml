# Notes:
# - need to enable "improved container support":
#   https://docs.github.com/en/packages/guides/enabling-improved-container-support
# - need to add an access token, probably at organisation level
# - need to remove `environment: build`

# TODO: create a tag/release with the version based on the version in package.json every time a
# merge is made to master?
on:
  # TODO: filter on vX.Y.Z (i.e. semantic-ish versioning)- ideally we'd have proper semantic
  # versioning, but let's see what happens. Or don't filter?
  # Or: only publish the :latest tag when the release name is a proper semantic version tag-
  # perhaps even without any suffixes?
